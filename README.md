# Slasher
A simple textbased game where you have to navigate your way out of a house while avoiding a slasher

This game has a fixed path and 2 possible ways of escaping the house. I didn't know how to end it, but its a nice little time waster.

The slasher will appear randomly - I used random.choice() to get this based on picking a number from a list of 5 - so they just appear and there isn't much you can really do about it but try again. I might adjust the RNG at some point in the future.

This is a pretty small and simple project - and my implementation may not be the best (I am still learning).

I made this to expand on what I have learnt from some of my other projects like my rock paper scissors game.

Its just a small little Halloween inspired thing - as we are now in spooky month ðŸŽƒðŸŽƒðŸŽƒ

Happy Halloween!
